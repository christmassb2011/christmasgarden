Today, I work up at 8:30 AM. My goal was:
- Learn Greenlandic.
- Create Christmas Vault.
- Create Christmas theme website, account and more...

Today, I ate cake and listen songs like Jingle Bells and Merry Christmas.

Today, I enjoyed lot, very lot. I want this day again and I am very exited for 2026 Christmas. Bye.
